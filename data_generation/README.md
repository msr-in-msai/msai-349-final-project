# Data Generation
The `./data_generation` folder contains scripts for generating the dataset for training and evaluating our model.
* `convert_dataset.py`: Convert the deleted RGB-D and Segmentation dataset into pointcloud as .csv files.
* `visualiz_dataset.py`: Visualize the .csv dataset file by giving a row index.
